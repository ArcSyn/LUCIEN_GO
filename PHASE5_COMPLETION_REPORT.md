## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Architecture Enhancements

#### 1. Comprehensive Built-in Command System
```go
// New comprehensive built-in registration
func (s *Shell) registerBuiltins() {
    // Core shell commands
    s.registerCoreBuiltins()
    // File and text processing built-ins  
    s.registerAdditionalBuiltins()
    // System command built-ins
    s.registerSystemBuiltins()
}
```

#### 2. Intelligent Agent Routing
```go
// Smart command routing with pattern matching
type AgentRouter struct {
    patterns map[string][]CommandPattern
}

func (ar *AgentRouter) SuggestAgent(command string, args []string) *AgentSuggestion {
    // Advanced pattern matching with confidence scoring
    // Contextual heuristics application
    // Natural language command transformation
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Security Framework
```go
// Comprehensive security validation and logging
func (b *Bridge) executeWithSecurity(command string, cmdArgs []string) (string, error) {
    // Timeout protection
    // Security logging
    // Output sanitization
    // Execution monitoring
}
```

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Integration Test Coverage
- **Agent Commands**: 16+ test scenarios across 4 agents
- **Shell Operations**: 40+ test cases across 8 categories  
- **Security Validation**: Timeout, injection, and policy tests
- **Cross-platform**: Windows and Unix command compatibility

#### Installation System
- **3 Installation Methods**: Go bootstrap, PowerShell, and Bash installers
- **Dependency Management**: Python detection, plugin installation, PATH setup
